## 3. Description

**DISPATCH: Night Shift** is a branching interactive story created using p5.js. The project builds on the Week 3 instructional example provided in GBDA 302, which demonstrated a multi-screen, state-based game structure with separate files for each screen.

Using the same architectural approach, this project extends the example by replacing the original random win/lose logic with a decision-driven narrative inspired by the game _Dispatch_. Players take on the role of an emergency dispatcher working a late-night shift during a severe storm. Each scene presents a choice between two actions, and those choices determine which scenes and ending the player experiences.

The game emphasizes clarity of interaction, keyboard accessibility, and consequence-based storytelling rather than chance.

**How to play:**

- On the start screen, click **BEGIN SHIFT** or press **ENTER**
- Read each dispatch scenario carefully
- Make choices by:
  - Clicking on-screen buttons, or
  - Pressing **1** or **2** on the keyboard
- Choices affect the narrative path and ending
- On the ending screens, click or press **R** to return to the start

## 5. Iteration Notes

### a. Post-Playtest (Three changes made)

1. Replaced the example’s random outcome system with explicit branching logic so outcomes were tied directly to player decisions.
2. Revised on-screen text and button labels after playtesting to make choices and consequences clearer.
3. Added keyboard shortcuts (1 / 2) to improve accessibility and reduce reliance on mouse input.

### b. Post-Showcase (Two planned improvements)

1. Introduce a persistent player stat (e.g., risk or trust) that influences endings more granularly.
2. Expand the decision tree with an additional mid-game scene to increase replayability.
